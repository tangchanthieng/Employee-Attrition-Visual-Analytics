# Employee-Attrition-Visual-Analytics

## 1. Project Overview  
Employees are the backbone of any organization. Its performance is heavily based on the quality of the employees and retaining them. With employee attrition, organizations are faced with a number of challenges:

- Expensive in terms of both money and time to train new employees
- Loss of experienced employees
- Impact on productivity
- Impact on profit
 
The primary objective of this project was to answer one critical business question: **“What factors are driving employee attrition, and how can organizations design effective retention strategies?”** By analyzing satisfaction levels, job roles, demographics, and promotion/compensation patterns, the project aims to deliver insights that HR leaders can use to reduce turnover and improve employee engagement.  

## 2. Process Overview

### 2.1 Business Objective
The organization aims to understand the factors driving employee attrition to reduce turnover, retain talent, and enhance both productivity and profitability. Addressing attrition is critical to maintaining organizational performance and sustaining competitive advantage.

### 2.2 Scope
This analysis will use the HR dataset (emp_attrition.csv) to explore employee attrition patterns. The focus will be on identifying key trends, uncovering underlying drivers, and presenting findings through Power BI visualizations for stakeholder review.

### 2.3 Business Requirements
The project requires a department-wise gender distribution analysis to detect imbalances, an assessment of attrition rates based on travel frequency, and a comparison of age distributions between employees who left and those who stayed. Additionally, it will identify the most significant attrition drivers, focusing on Department, OverTime, JobLevel, and JobSatisfaction.

### 2.4 Success Criteria
The analysis will be successful if it produces clear, interactive visualizations that directly address the research questions. Insights must also be actionable, enabling HR to design effective retention strategies and improve workforce stability.
