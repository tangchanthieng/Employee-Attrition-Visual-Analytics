## 1. Project Overview

Employees are the backbone of any organization. Its performance is heavily based on the quality of the employees and retaining them. With employee attrition, organizations are faced with a number of challenges:

- Expensive in terms of both money and time to train new employees
- Loss of experienced employees
- Impact on productivity
- Impact on profit
 
The primary objective of this project was to answer one critical business question: **“What factors are driving employee attrition, and how can organizations design effective retention strategies?”** By analyzing satisfaction levels, job roles, demographics, and promotion/compensation patterns, the project aims to deliver insights that HR leaders can use to reduce turnover and improve employee engagement.  

### 2. Objectives

The organization aims to understand the factors driving employee attrition to reduce turnover, retain talent, and enhance both productivity and profitability. Addressing attrition is critical to maintaining organizational performance and sustaining competitive advantage.

### 3. Requirements

The project requires a department-wise gender distribution analysis to detect imbalances, an assessment of attrition rates based on travel frequency, and a comparison of age distributions between employees who left and those who stayed. Additionally, it will identify the most significant attrition drivers, focusing on Department, OverTime, JobLevel, and JobSatisfaction.
