# Employee-Attrition-Visual-Analytics

## 1. Project Overview  
This project explores **employee attrition patterns** using a dataset of 1,470 employees. Leveraging **Power BI**, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize key workforce trends such as attrition rate, job satisfaction, demographic breakdowns, promotion opportunities, and compensation dynamics.  

The dashboard provides a holistic view of workforce stability and highlights the risk factors contributing to turnover.  

## 2. Objective  
The primary objective of this project was to answer one critical business question:  
**“What factors are driving employee attrition, and how can organizations design effective retention strategies?”**  

By analyzing satisfaction levels, job roles, demographics, and promotion/compensation patterns, the project aims to deliver insights that HR leaders can use to reduce turnover and improve employee engagement.  

## 3. Process Overview  
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and structured HR dataset (1,470 records, multiple categorical and numerical attributes).  
- **Dashboard Development**: Built interactive visualizations in **Power BI Desktop** to explore attrition distribution across age, gender, job role, and tenure.  
- **Analytics**:  
  - Attrition rate: **16% overall** – within the industry benchmark but skewed toward early-career employees.  
  - Age factor: Attrition peaks at **25–30 years**, stabilizes after **30–40 years**.  
  - Gender factor: Workforce is **60:40 male-to-female**, with imbalance pronounced in R&D and HR.  
  - Role factor: **Sales reps, executives, and lab technicians** show the highest attrition risk.  
  - Satisfaction levels: Hover around **2.7/4 (~68%)**, suggesting lukewarm engagement.  
  - Compensation & promotion: Salary hikes alone don’t prevent turnover; promotion inequities by marital status hint at bias risks.  
- **Recommendations**: Targeted retention for early-career staff, role redesign in sales, promotion transparency audits, and enhanced manager training.
